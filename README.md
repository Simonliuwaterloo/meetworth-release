# Meetworth
The release version of **Meetworth**, an android application that helps you meetup with your friends. Just type in your firend's location, this app will bring up some places between you and your friend for you two to meet up!  
As of 2021 September, I have taken it off Google Play Store to save me some GCP money ðŸ™‚. I wasn't familiar with Flutter/dart when I made this. But it was a good exercise for creating an application from scratch and publishing it on app stores.

# Local Setup
